# T20_World_Cup_Prediction
Welcome to the T20 Winning Probability Repository on Github! This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that analyze T20 cricket match data and predict the winning probability of a team in a T20 match.

The repository contains data for T20 matches played between 2005 and 2021. 
The data includes information such as the date of the match, the teams playing, the venue, the scorecard, and the outcome of the match.

The repository uses various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to analyze the data and predict the winning probability of a team. 
The scripts use various features such as the team's past performance, the venue's history, and the player's statistics to predict the outcome of a match.

The repository also contains a Jupyter notebook that explains the methodology used to predict the winning probability of a team. 
The notebook also provides examples of how to use the scripts to analyze the data and predict the outcome of a T20 match.

The repository is intended for cricket enthusiasts and data scientists who are interested in analyzing T20 cricket match data and predicting the outcome of a match. 
The scripts can be used as a starting point for developing more advanced machine learning models for predicting the outcome of T20 matches.

Feel free to use the repository and provide feedback on how it can be improved. Happy analyzing!
